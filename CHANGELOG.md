## [Unreleased]

The repository scaffold is version `0.0.0`; no release has been made.

### Added

- Initial `.agents` workspace repository scaffold.
- Agent-facing repository instructions in `AGENTS.md`.
- Reusable skill directory placeholder under `skills/`.
- Contribution, versioning, and changelog conventions.
- MIT License.
- General-purpose, prompt-only `semver-bump` skill for version recommendations
  and confirmed version metadata updates.
- Six EngFlow skills for workspace navigation, research, clarification,
  document synthesis, conversational design review, and implementation.
- Long-task dependency graphs, one progress record, optional fresh-context
  workers, and serial write ownership in the existing checkout.
- Model-independent context management and EngFlow usage/validation guides.

### Changed

- Require user-approved feature integration as one rebased, squashed commit.
- Promote `dev` to `main` with fast-forward only, without shared-history rewrites.
- Define release authorization, baseline checks, and the `0.x` version policy.
- Keep the root catalog general so additional skills can be maintained alongside
  EngFlow.

### Removed

- GitHub pull request template; pull requests are optional in the personal workflow.
